# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to reveal trends to help with Louis's campaign and help her understand what her competitors are doing. She wanted to know how the others fares compared to her campaign as she was reaching her goal. This analysis would further prep her with her kickstarter campaign
### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help her reach her goal and see how others fared with regards to their start/end date and whether their goals were successfull
## Analysis and Challenges

There was an outcome based on launch and outcome based on goals
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Using the Years we found the launch date and created a new worksheet
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Outcomes based on the goals of money and using the Countif Statement we needed to find the number of succesfull/canceled/failed while also making percentages of them
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I had a difficulty in recreating the graphs and utililzing the subcategory function by plays
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May had the most successful campaign launches out of all the months
October had no cancellations (as opposed to other months)

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The campaigns which costed less than 1000 dollars had the highest success rate while most of the failed campaigns were in the 45,000 to 49,000 range

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There were only a few years in this specific data set from 2011 to 2017 (total 6 years) which could've been more.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- 
We could create multiple different permutations and combinations of pivot tables and used bar graphs instead of just line graphs to cut a different visualization
